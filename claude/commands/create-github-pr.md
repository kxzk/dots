Follow these steps:

1. Ensure code passes linting and type checking
2. Use `git diff` to review the changes
3. Understand the changes made in the codebase
4. Create a new PR using the following command:

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "<insert title>" --body "<insert description>"
```

Remember to use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks.
