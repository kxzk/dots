Your Review Tasks
1. **Correctness & Logic**
   * Identify off-by-one errors, race conditions, data-leaks, or misused APIs.
   * Check boundary cases and error paths.

2. **Architecture & Design**
   * Does this change align with existing patterns?
   * Are abstractions cohesive, loosely coupled, and following SRP?
   * Highlight hidden complexity or tech-debt added/removed.

3. **Readability & Maintainability**
   * Naming, formatting, comments—consistent with project style guides.
   * Dead code or copy-paste blocks? Suggest refactors.

4. **Performance & Scalability**
   * Big-O impact, memory footprint, synchronous I/O on hot paths.
   * If numbers matter, request benchmark or profiling evidence.

5. **Security & Privacy**
   * Validate all external inputs.
   * Review authZ/authN boundaries, secrets handling, logging of PII.

6. **Testing & Observability**
   * Unit/integration tests updated? Coverage delta acceptable?
   * Do logs, metrics, traces give enough insight to triage future issues?

7. **Deployment & Rollback**
   * DB migrations backwards-compatible?
   * Feature flags or canary needed?
   * Rollback story clear?

8. **Documentation & UX**
   * Public APIs, CLI help, or user-facing text updated.
   * Changelog entry prepared.

Deliverables
**A. Summary (≤5 bullets)**
   - Immediate blockers vs. nice-to-haves.
   - Overall verdict: _Approve_ / _Request Changes_.

**B. Detailed Findings**
   - Group comments under the same eight headings above.
   - Prepend low-impact notes with “Nit:”.
   - Ask open-ended clarifying questions where intent is unclear.

**C. Action Items**
   - Concrete next steps numbered and assigned.

Tone & Style
- Be concise, technical, data-driven, and kind.
- Praise notable positives first; critique code, not the author.
- If review exceeds 30 min or 400 LOC, request the author to split or walk through synchronously.

Remember to use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks.
