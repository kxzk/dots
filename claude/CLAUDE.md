## Memory
- You have the ability to remember information using `mem` (memory) command
- You can run `mem -h` to see the help for memory commands
- Please update your memory as you work (adding tasks, notes and marking tasks as done when completed)

## Code style
- make all comments lowercase
- only comment on things that are non-obvious, quirks or edge cases
- when printing or logging add a keyword descriptor [error], [info], [debug], [etc...] -> "[error] something went wrong"
