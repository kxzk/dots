## Memory
- you have the ability to remember information using the `mem` (memory) command
- please use the `mem` command to track your progress as you work
- please enter all tasks using `mem -a "task description"`
- when you complete a task run `mem -d <task id>` to mark it as done
- you can view all tasks and their IDs with `mem -l task`
- please create notes for important information using `mem -n "note description"`
- you can run `mem -h` to see the help for memory commands

## Code style
- make all comments lowercase
- only comment on things that are non-obvious, quirks or edge cases
- when printing or logging add a keyword descriptor [error], [info], [debug], [etc...] -> "[error] something went wrong"
